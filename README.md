 🤖 Autonomous Obstacle-Avoiding Robot with Environment Monitoring

This is a smart Arduino-based robot capable of autonomously navigating its environment using an ultrasonic sensor while simultaneously monitoring temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor. 
Real-time environmental data is transmitted via the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, making it ideal for integrating robotics with basic IoT.


 🔍 About the Project
